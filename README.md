# Text-Based Wordle

This basic Python application is, - as the title of this markdown implies -a simple, text-based 'Wordle' application. The idea is simple: you have six(6) tries to guess a randomly generated word. Because this is a text-based version of the game, there are no color codes (yet...*wink, wink*). The rules are outlined in the next section of this document.

# Rules

If you aren't familiar with the rules of the game, here are the official rules (as outlined by tomsguide.com):

- You have to guess the Worlde in six goes or less
- Every word you enter must be in the world list.
- A correct letter turns green.
- A correct letter in the wrong place turns yellow.
- An incorrect letter turns gray
- Letters can be used more than once
- Answers are never plurals

Obvously, all of these rules are not applied in this version. Here, the following rules apply:

- You have to guess in six guesses or less.
- The word guessed must be in the list.
- A correct letter is indicated by a tick (check) mark.
- A correct letter in the incorrect position is indicated by an asterisk (\*)
- An incorrect letter is indicated by an X
- Letters can be used more than once
- Answers *can* be plurals as of now
